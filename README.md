# Complexity

- A library for `Markov Chain Monte Carlo` simulations applied to `AI` `LLM` streaming responses.

- Evaluate the financial value of any given `prompt-response` pair w.r.t. an MCMC simulation.
- Designed to learn temporally or improve in accuracy over time.
- [Black-Scholes warning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model) ðŸ¦†

- *Install the Library, via the instructions below to learn more and apply the model to your own LLM streaming...*

### Installation Instructions

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.16. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.


## What is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sim.?

### Basic History and Motivation

Written in the mid 20th-century, the [Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) can "handle complex, high-dimensional, and non-standard distributions in financial modeling... it's a powerful tool for pricing, risk management, and uncertainty quantification".
